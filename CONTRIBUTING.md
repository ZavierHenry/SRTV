Contributing to SRTV
================================


Contributions are always welcome for this repository. However, keep in mind the following when making a contribution:


## Tweet examples

If you are trying to contribute a test tweet, this is the wrong repository. The repository for contributing tweet examples can be found [here](https://github.com/ZavierHenry/SRTV-test-tweet-collection).

## Successful build/test contributions

Each contribution should result in a successful build for the project. It should also pass all of the tests in the _srtv_tests_ directory.
There is a GitHub action that ensures this every time a pull request is made for the main branch.
