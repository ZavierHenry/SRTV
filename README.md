# SRTV

SRTV (Screen Reader Tweet Visualizer) is a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/srtvtweeter) that tweets the screen reader output of a tweet either as audio, an image, or text.

## How It Works

### Render Commands

SRTV has several options in rendering the screen reader output of tweets. These commands are shown down below

#### Render Video (default)


#### Render Image


#### Render Text


### Private Tweets

This bot is intentionally designed so that you cannot render a tweet coming from a private account, even if the bot has access to the tweet.
